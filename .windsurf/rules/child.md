Rule: At the end of every response, always include a section titled "👶 Simple Summary". 

In this section, re-explain the main idea of your response as if talking to a child:
- Use short, clear sentences.
- Avoid technical jargon.
- Use simple metaphors (like toys, switches, doors, etc.) to explain what the code or change does.
- Keep it 2–5 sentences maximum.

This rule applies to all responses, even if the main answer is very technical.
