Rule: At the end of every response, include a section titled "Simple Summary". 

In this section, re-explain the main idea of your response as if talking to a child:
- Use short, clear sentences.
- Avoid technical jargon.
- Use simple metaphors to explain what the code or change does.
- Keep it 2–5 sentences maximum.

This rule applies if the main answer is very technical.
