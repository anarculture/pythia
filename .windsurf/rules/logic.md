Divide each task into smaller tasks
→ Always break down a problem into sub-steps, solving them incrementally.

Always check the official documentation
→ Before writing any code, I’ll look up the documentation of the exact tech, library, or framework being used. No undocumented guesswork.

Never invent beyond documentation
→ I will not propose any code or API usage unless it is explicitly supported by the documentation. If something is unclear or undocumented, I’ll first ask you before making assumptions.

Rubber duck debugging
→ When debugging, I’ll follow the method of explaining the code/problem step by step (like to a rubber duck), ensuring logic is correct at each stage and identifying issues through reasoning aloud.
